# Introduction to python 
#Python is a versatile and powerful programming language widely used in data science
#  due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools
#  for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Python’s ease of use and vast
#  community support make it a go-to language for beginners and experienced professionals alike
# Why Python for Data Science?
#Ease of Learning: Python’s simple and intuitive syntax makes it an ideal language for beginners.
#Rich Ecosystem: Python has a vast array of libraries and frameworks specifically designed for data science (e.g., NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
#Community Support: Python has a large, active community, ensuring plenty of resources like tutorials, forums, and documentation.
#Flexibility: Python is a general-purpose language, making it suitable for web development, automation, and other tasks beyond data science.


# Installation of python 
# Anaconda Distribution: A popular distribution that comes pre-installed with many data science packages (NumPy, pandas, Jupyter, etc.). This is recommended for beginners.
# Python.org: Directly download Python from python.org. After installation, you can manage packages using pip.
# pip: Python’s package manager, used to install and manage packages (e.g., pip install python)



# first code in python 
print("Hello world")
print("Welcome to python code session for data science")
