# Day-1 [11 June 2024]
# Topic Studied : Introduction to data science 
# Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods,
#  processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights 
# from structured and unstructured data. It combines aspects of statistics, 
# computer science, mathematics, domain expertise, and data engineering to 
# analyze and interpret data in ways that help organizations make data-driven decisions.
# key points 
#1. Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources such as databases, web scraping, sensors, or social media.
#2. Data Cleaning: Preparing the data for analysis by removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting errors, and ensuring consistency.
#3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features (variables) or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
#4. Statistical Analysis: Using statistical techniques to draw conclusions and insights from data.
#5. Machine Learning: Applying algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on the data, either through supervised (with labeled data) or unsupervised (without labels) learning.
#6. Data Visualization: Presenting data insights and results in visual formats such as charts, graphs, and dashboards to help stakeholders understand findings.
#7. Model Deployment: Taking machine learning models from experimentation to production so they can be used in real-world applications.
#8. Big Data Technologies: Working with large datasets that cannot fit into traditional systems, using tools like Hadoop, Spark, or cloud platforms.
#8. Domain Knowledge: Understanding the specific field (e.g., finance, healthcare, marketing) in which the data is being analyzed to make sense of the data in context.
